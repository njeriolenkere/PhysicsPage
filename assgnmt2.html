	                        <p>The answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, according to Douglas Adams’ excellent book, is 42. The reality, it turns out, is not quite so simple.
                            Questions about what the universe is, how it began, how it works and where it is going have exercised the minds of some of the smartest scientists of the 20th Century and, while huge strides have been made in pinning down the science underlying the workings of the universe, some stubborn obstacles still remain. In fact, it does sometimes seem that the more we learn and the more questions we answer, the more there is to learn and the more new questions arise.</p>

                    <h3>The beginnings of of life</h3>
                           <p>What are the origins of life on Earth? How did things go from non-living to living, from something that could not reproduce to something that could? How can a collection of inanimate atoms become animate? How did organic molecules achieve a high enough level of complexity to be considered as “living”? The short answer is: we do not really know how life originated on this planet. The longer answer, however, is much more interesting.</p>
